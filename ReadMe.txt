This project was an attempt to learn about Deep Learning techniques. We collected a dataset of images of three age gorups of people infants, middle aged and old aged people. The data was stored in three folders as per its category.

Results achieved are,
- Manged to get grip on Tensorflow algorithm and its parameters which are often used to fine tune the results.
- Got accuracy of 95% to get excellent results.
- Used a webcam to take pictures of people in real time to test against trained model.
